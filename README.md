===============

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Python descriptor.
To demonstrate one of the uses, a Django project is included. In the project,
Python descriptor is used to encrypt and decrypt a `db.models.CharField`.
Read the file [sample/secret/models.py](sample/secret/models.py) for details.
